# Laborator 2

- **Compulsory (1p)**
  - Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have (at least) the following classes: Location, Road.
  - Implement the location and road types as enums.
  - Each class should have appropriate constructors, getters, and setters.
  - Utilize IDE features for code generation, such as generating getters and setters.
  - Properly override the `toString` method from the `Object` class for all the classes.
  - Utilize IDE features for code generation, e.g., in NetBeans, press Alt+Ins or invoke the context menu, select "Insert Code" and then "toString()" (or simply start typing "toString" and then press Ctrl+Space).
  - Create and print on the screen various objects of the two classes.

- **Homework (2p)**
  - Create a class that describes an instance of the problem.
  - Override the `Object.equals` method for the Location and Road classes. Ensure that the problem does not allow adding the same location or road twice.
  - Instead of using an enum, create dedicated classes for locations (e.g., cities, airports, gas stations) or roads (e.g., highway, express, country). Each concrete location class may have additional specific properties (population, number of terminals, gas price, etc.).
  - Implement a method that determines if an instance of the problem is valid.
  - Implement an algorithm for determining if it is possible to travel from one location to another using the given roads.
  - Write doc comments in your source code and generate class documentation using javadoc.
